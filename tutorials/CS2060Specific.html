            <h2>Design Notebook</h2>
            A note on the design notebook before we move on. I admit in a class of this level it is a bit silly to use (for people who have experience)
            but for people with little to no experience, it is a very good idea to get started with proper design principles early instead of learning
            them by neccecaty when a project exceeds their capacity. <i>If you are experienced</i> then play along and roll play as though you were turning 
            a more important design into your boss. Pretend that you actually have a customer and think about it in that perspective and extrapolate what they might
            want from what they say, you don't have to implement it, just comment on it and think of designs and maybe write a few.

                <h3>MUST DOS:</h6>
                <li><b>Include Tasks.</b> That is read all user stories and requirements and parse that into information on exactly what you need to do and what you don't
                you are free to speculate and consider additional things, just ensure your provide a well formatted list or flow chart of all functionality of the program
                broken down into tasks</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Include Test Cases.</b> provide a nicely formatted chart of expected I/O. Think of it from the stand point of writing an auto grader for your assignment. If
                    you were to write that auto grader, think of everything you would want to check for, what might cause issues, what should throw errors, what should silently handle
                    errors, what should pass what should fail. <i>Best Practice:</i> put breaking cases as the top of the list, IE: any case that might crash or throw an error.
                </li>
                    <b>Function Prototypes.</b> Include function Prototypes in your designs, that is: what does this function take IE: parameters and what does this function return.
                    Keep in mind passing parameters as constants and making sure you specify type and var name in prototypes.
                <li>
                <li>
                    <b>Function Psuodocode.</b> Include psuodocode for every function that you wrote a prototype for. <i>Best practice:</i> Also include some psuodocode for any tasks you didn't
                    write prototypes for, just indicate that you thought about implementing it and changed your mind.
                    <br>
                    <i>Note on psuodocode:</i> Deb has a very broad definition of psuodocode unlike some profs who want text only. I recommend including pictures, diagrams or flowcharts
                    mixed into or nearby your psuodocode.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Pictures, Pictures, Pictures:</b> Include as many pictures and diagrams as you can to help explain things. <b>MUST:</b> include pictures relating to main's flow
                    and any hard concept, she does not list this explicitly but I strongly strongly, recommend doing so.

                    <!-- Code Must Dos -->
                    <h3>MUST DOS:</h6>
                    <li><b>YOU WILL GET A 0% if you use infinite loops</b></li>
                    <li><b>DO NOT use break statements</b></li>
                    <li><b>DO NOT use multiple returns.</b> (both her and myself are aware there are very good uses for this, stop being a smart ass and follow her style for her class)
                    <br>
                    If you need an explanation, she is trying to teach structured programming, and a lot of people use multiple returns as a crutch. Its easier to disallow them for everyone than 
                    try to check if people are using them well or not. 
                    </li>
                      <!-- Code Documentation Style Unordered List -->
                    <li><b>Documentation Style</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Documentation Comments.</b> 
                                <br>Place documentation comments above every function. 
                                <br>They should provide a brief description, the params, and the return type
                            Documentation comments should be placed above prototypes, I followed DoxGen C standard and she was fine with that. I recommend choosing any popular standardized
                            documentation style and declaring that you are following that standard.

                                You should start every c program with a multiline comment at the top of your code with the following:

                                    <li>Brief description of the project. Do not use general language, pretend you are writing a real description of a real project.
                                        What does this program do? Don't focus on what it will teach you, focus on what it does here.

                                    <li>(optional) I like to add a note to the grader explaining specific choices, not a neccecaty, but might save you a point or two on occasion.</li>
