It appears that since we are using %esi which we know to be 32 bit move can unambiguously assume we are moving 32 bits?<br><br>
                        We are moving the literal hex value 0x402480 (dec: 4203648) into the %esi subdivision of %rsi. <br><br>
                        Since we did not provide a suffix and we are assuming 32bit from register length, I believe that means the actual value we are moving is 0x00402480 <br>
                        %esi is the 32bit subdivision of %rsi --where %rsi is the second parameter register.

                        it appears that We are calling the label &lt;strings_not_equal&gt; at the address 0x4012ce. Im not sure why we are using callq and passing a 32bit value though. <br>
                        So to verify our hypothesis that we are calling the label &lt;strings_not_equal&gt; at the address 0x4012ce. Lets use disas on that label and see what we get.

                        We test if %eax AND %eax is 0 and set ZF (the zero flag) occordingly. Im not entirely sure how these condition flags work, I think they are just single bits but Im not really sure where they are? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register">see</a>.<br>
                        Okay so it looks like there is a 64 bit register storing 64 1 bit flags, so it is a physical cpu register that stores 64 separate flags as far as I can tell it doesn't have a '%rzx' type thing to address it it appears to just be called FLAGS/flags register
                        <br>So we are checking if %eax AND %eax is 0 which would mean %eax itself needs to be 0 for this to set the ZF flag to true.

                        We are using callq (so quadword, 64bit). Given this we are calling the function
                        at 0x0000000000401534 in memory, since q implies 64 bit so we fill the rest with zeros since 
                        we only specified the last 3 bytes. Note that 34 at the end is the LSB as its at the end and 0x00 is the MSB although 0x40 is 
                        the MSB of the value we passed. Computers are little-endian so LSB at lowest memory address.

                        we are comparing the value stored at %rbp to the last bit of %rax (%al)<br>
                        I dont really understand what the whole 0x0 is about Ill probably ask in office hours<br>
                        So we are testing %al - *0x0(%rbp).<br>
                        (%rbp) is the first element on our stack so its our original %r12 value?<br>
                        if %al < *0x0(%rbp) CF=1, ZF=0;<br>
                        if %al > *0x0(%rbp) CF=0, ZF=0;<br>
                        if %al=*0x0(%rbp) CF=0, ZF=1;<br>
                        <br>
                        since %al is 0000<br>
                        CF will always be 0<br>
                        ZF will be 1 if %r12 is 0 else it will be 1 <br>

                        So what are we doing here? We are comparing some junk in %r12 to %al
